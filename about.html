<h2> About us </h2>

<p><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold"> Before exploring us.... you might have a question in mind, i guess. <br>
who are these guys?<br>
maybe, a bunch of idiots who likes wasting their time by making these useless websites...</span><br>
Now you might be thinking how do i know all that...... well because most websites like these are truly a waste of time and nothing else, but not ours!!<br>
Here, we emphasize on <span class="fun"> learning by fun...</span> <em>new technology </em>... what's trending... and of course a forum to answer your questions... an image gallery with some stunning pictures of the month... and much more for you to not get bored here...

As I say : 

<blockquote class="fun">

Learning is not boring, if you do it in a interesting way...
